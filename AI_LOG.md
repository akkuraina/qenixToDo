## AI Usage Declaration

During the development of this project, ChatGPT was used as a learning and debugging assistant.

### How AI Was Used

ChatGPT was used for:

- Understanding NestJS module structure and dependency injection
- Debugging common backend errors (e.g., JWT configuration, provider resolution)
- Clarifying JWT authentication flow
- Understanding frontend–backend integration
- Reviewing architectural decisions
- Improving documentation structure

AI was primarily used to:

- Clarify concepts
- Suggest best practices
- Help interpret error messages
- Validate understanding of full-stack integration

---

## What AI Was NOT Used For

- The application logic was not blindly generated.
- All suggested code was reviewed and manually tested.
- Integration issues were debugged and resolved through manual testing.
- API flows were verified using Postman and browser DevTools.
- JWT authentication and database interactions were tested independently.

All code included in the final submission was:

- Understood before integration
- Modified where necessary
- Debugged during implementation
- Verified end-to-end

---

## Developer Responsibility

The final system architecture, API structure, authentication flow, and frontend–backend integration were implemented with a full understanding of:

- NestJS modular architecture
- JWT authentication
- MongoDB schema design
- React Context state management
- RESTful API principles

AI was used strictly as a learning and debugging support tool — not as an automated code generator replacing understanding.
